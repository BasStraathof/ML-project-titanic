# ML-project-titanic
Machine Learning final project - Philip Hartout, Vincent Roest &amp; Bas Straathof

The report is \texttt{research\_paper.pdf} and all Python code can be found in \texttt{titanic.ipynb}.

The data set is attached under \texttt{train.csv}, and Graphviz could be used to visualize \texttt{tree.dot} (please see \texttt{decision\_tree.pdf} for the fully visualized decision tree).

Furthermore, the proposal is added \texttt{proposal.pdf} and all the plots that are in the report can be found in the sub-folder 'images'.
